# spotify-song-skip-prediction

This is the code for my ML project [Spotify Skip Prediction Challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge). The goal is to predict whether Spotify users will skip given songs, using information about user behaviors and track features provided by Spotify. I chose to work with the mini dataset that contains two csv files (log_mini.csv and tf_mini.csv), which can be obtained after [downloading from this website](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge/dataset_files) and "untar" the file. This project mainly explored user behaviors, applied logistic regression and random forest models, and visualized important features and model performance metrics. Unlock the secrets of song engagement on Spotify!
